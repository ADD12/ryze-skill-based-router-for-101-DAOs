Ryze: The AI Governance Engine
Ryze is the central intelligence of this system. It's a collection of services, likely running on a cloud platform or offline in a Mesh Fog AI community with little connectivity.
AI-driven systems, DAOs, and collaborative coding environments, DAOs can design a sophisticated and dynamic skill-based routing infrastructure governed by an AI agent named Rye.

This system will integrate with Slack for real-time communication and dynamically manage support tasks based on team member availability and expertise, particularly for errors that arise before a recurring deadline like a weekly meeting.
This closed-loop system where:
1. Job Monitoring: Systems (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, supercomputer schedulers, etc.) report their status to a central hub.

2. Error Ingestion: When a job fails, it sends a detailed error payload to an event bus.

3. AI Triage (Ryze): Ryze intercepts the error, parses it to understand the context and required skills (e.g., Python, CUDA, CesiumJS, database-admin).

4. Dynamic Roster Management: Rye maintains a real-time status of all team members, their skills, and their availability, which is updated automatically based on their Slack status.

5. Intelligent Routing: Rye queries its roster to find the best-suited, available team member who is not the original owner of the failed job.

6. Slack-based Action & Communication: Ryze assigns the task via a direct, interactive message in a dedicated Slack channel, and manages the entire support lifecycle through Slack.![RYE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2781c7c2-427e-4bca-98ee-65f8fb8eb41a)
